### Efficient Tweet Similarity Search Using Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

### Project Overview

This project implements an efficient version of k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) using locality sensitive hashing (LSH) to find similar tweets. The main steps include:

1. **Tweet Processing**: Convert tweets into vector embeddings representing the content of each tweet.
2. **Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)**: Use LSH to quickly identify candidate tweets that are similar to a given tweet.
3. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**: Apply k-NN to the candidates identified by LSH to find the most similar tweets accurately.

### Key Components

- **Vector Embeddings**: Transform tweets into vector representations using techniques like TF-IDF, word2vec, or other embedding models.
- **Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)**: Efficiently reduce the search space by hashing similar tweets into the same buckets.
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**: Perform detailed similarity search on the reduced set of candidate tweets to find the top k nearest neighbors.

### Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Significantly reduces the computational cost of finding similar tweets compared to traditional k-NN.
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets of tweets effectively by narrowing down the search space with LSH.
